# Webhooks

Webhooks let you register a URL that Chargehound will notify when an event occurs. You might want to use webhooks to be notified when a dispute is created so that you can automatically submit a response. You can configure your webhook URLs on your [settings page](https://www.chargehound.com/dashboard/settings/api#webhook-settings), clicking *Add webhook URL* on that page reveals a form to add a new URL for receiving webhooks. You can select what events you would like to receive a notification for. The events are `dispute.created`, `dispute.updated`, `dispute.submitted`, `dispute.closed` and `dispute.response.generated`.

## Static IP addresses

If you need to allowlist individual IP addresses in your firewall you can opt to have webhook calls sent from a fixed range of IP addresses on your [settings page](https://www.chargehound.com/dashboard/settings/api#webhook-settings). 

> Webhook calls will then be sent from one of the following IP addresses if you opt to use a static IP:

```
3.211.115.112
3.212.160.248
3.212.186.185
34.194.118.97
34.200.90.111
``` 

## Responding to a webhook

To acknowledge successful receipt of a webhook, your endpoint should return a `2xx` HTTP status code. Any other information returned in the request headers or request body is ignored. All response codes outside this range, including `3xx` codes, will be treated as a failure. If a webhook is not successfully received for any reason, Chargehound will continue trying to send the webhook once every half hour for up to 3 days.
